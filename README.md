# sl-pishock
A work in progress PiShock relay for second life.

Right this is in the proof of concept phase. I may work on this more later, but don't count on it.

If you do end up doing anything with this, please shoot me a message at BE39 Resident on Second Life, I'd be interested to see what you do.
Additionally, please credit this repository if you decide to sell this as a product on the Marketboard.
